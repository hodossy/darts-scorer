# Darts Scorer

This project was created, so that I can understand Angular concepts and techniques. I hope you enjoy using the app! If you find a bug or you would like to see a new feature, please report it in the issues tab on this repository.

The application is hosted at [Darts Scorer](https://hodossy.github.io/darts-scorer/).

_It is currently in alpha, and updates may be delayed due to my other responsibilities._
